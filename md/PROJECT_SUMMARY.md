# Clear Piggy Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
Clear Piggy is a personal finance management application with bank integration via Plaid, transaction tracking, and financial analytics. This document summarizes all work completed during this session.

## 📋 Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ User Signup & Authentication Flow
**Problem:** Needed to test complete user signup flow from account creation to dashboard access.

**Solution:**
- Verified database schema and RLS policies
- Tested user signup with automatic workspace creation
- Fixed workspace assignment issues
- Implemented proper authentication state management

**Key Files:**
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main routing logic
- `/src/components/Auth.tsx` - Login/signup forms
- `/src/hooks/useWorkspace.ts` - Workspace management hook

---

### 2. ✅ Plaid Bank Integration & Transaction Sync
**Problem:** Transactions weren't syncing properly due to token encryption issues.

**Solution:**
- Fixed AES-GCM encryption/decryption in edge function
- Implemented proper token storage and retrieval
- Added transaction enrichment (logos, categories, locations)
- Fixed transaction direction logic (inflow/outflow)

**Key Files:**
- `/supabase/functions/workspace-sync-transactions/index.ts`
- Transaction enrichment with merchant logos and PFCs working correctly

**SQL Fixes Applied:**
```sql
-- Fixed token encryption issues
-- Updated transaction direction logic
-- Added proper merchant enrichment
```

---

### 3. ✅ Transaction Display Issues
**Problem:** All transactions showing as negative amounts, incorrect debit/credit classification.

**Solution:**
- Fixed by using `direction` field ('inflow'/'outflow') instead of amount signs
- Properly mapped inflow → credit (income) and outflow → debit (expense)
- Color-coded display (green for credits, black for debits)

**Code Fix:**
```typescript
type: t.direction === 'inflow' ? 'credit' : 'debit'
```

---

### 4. ✅ Random Loading Screen Issues
**Problem:** Dashboard showing "Setting up workspace..." randomly when idle or switching tabs.

**Solutions Applied:**
1. Removed TOKEN_REFRESHED event handler that triggered unnecessary refreshes
2. Fixed workspace loading state management
3. Added proper loading state conditions
4. Prevented re-renders when switching browser tabs

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `/src/App.tsx` to only show loading when truly needed
- Updated useWorkspace hook to prevent unnecessary reloads
- Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

---

### 5. ✅ Onboarding Flow Implementation
**Problem:** New users going straight to empty dashboard instead of onboarding.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive 4-step onboarding wizard:
  1. Welcome screen
  2. Workspace setup (name & type)
  3. Bank connection via Plaid
  4. Completion confirmation
- Added `onboarding_completed` field to workspaces table
- Implemented proper routing based on onboarding status

**Key Files:**
- `/src/components/Onboarding.tsx` - Complete onboarding component
- `/add-onboarding-field.sql` - Database migration

---

### 6. ✅ Infinite Refresh Loop Fix
**Problem:** Dashboard getting stuck in loading state when refreshing.

**Solutions:**
- Used `useRef` to prevent multiple concurrent initializations
- Fixed circular dependencies in hooks
- Simplified App.tsx logic
- Added workspace refresh on sign in

**Key Pattern:**
```typescript
const isInitializing = useRef(false);
if (isInitializing.current) return;
```

---

### 7. ✅ Onboarding Not Showing for New Users
**Problem:** Despite `onboarding_completed: false`, new signups bypassed onboarding.

**Solution:**
- Added workspace refresh on SIGNED_IN event
- Fixed workspace state detection in App.tsx
- Ensured proper re-render when workspace loads
- Mark onboarding complete immediately after bank connection

---

### 8. ✅ Chart Flickering Issues
**Problem:** Cash flow chart flickering/re-animating constantly.

**Solutions:**
1. Created separate memoized `CashFlowChart` component
2. Implemented custom comparison function with React.memo
3. Disabled recharts animations
4. Fixed chart data regeneration with useMemo
5. Added gradient fills for better visuals

**Key File:**
- `/src/components/CashFlowChart.tsx` - Memoized chart component

---

### 9. ✅ Console Log Cleanup
**Problem:** Excessive debug logging causing console spam.

**Solution:**
- Removed debug console.log statements
- Kept only essential error logging
- Cleaned up workspace and App component logging

---

### 10. ✅ Color Scheme Development
**Created Three Different Themes:**

#### a) Green Gradient Theme (Initial)
- Bright, playful green gradients
- Multiple gradient variations
- Animated effects
- **Feedback:** Too cartoony/playful

#### b) Modern Sophisticated Theme (Refined)
- Muted sage greens (#5a745a)
- Stone gray neutrals
- Minimal, professional design
- Subtle accents only
- Enterprise-ready appearance

#### c) Mercury-Inspired Bookkeeping Dashboard
- Neo-bank design aesthetic
- Horizontal navigation
- Advanced transaction management
- Bulk actions and filtering
- Professional data tables

**Files Created:**
- `/color-schemes/green-gradient-theme.css`
- `/color-schemes/modern-sophisticated-theme.css`
- `/color-schemes/preview-green-theme.html`
- `/color-schemes/modern-dashboard-preview.html`
- `/color-schemes/mercury-bookkeeping-dashboard.html`

**Preview Server:** Running on http://localhost:8080

## 🚀 Current Application Flow

1. **New User Journey:**
   ```
   Signup → Auto workspace creation → Onboarding wizard → 
   Connect bank → Sync transactions → Dashboard
   ```

2. **Returning User Journey:**
   ```
